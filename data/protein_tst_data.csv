This solution was added to the protein as 1/50th part by volume and the resultant mixture utilized for crystallization experiments.  The initial crystals were grown by hanging drop by mixing 5 ?l of protein solution and 5 ?l of a solution containing 9-11% dimethyl-PEG 5000, 50 mM MOPS, 1% MPD, 1 mM NaN3, pH 7.0 and suspending the droplets over 600 ?l precipitant at 20 C, VAPOR DIFFUSION, HANGING DROP, temperature 293K",7,2004,

The C-terminal domain (137-322) (~20mg/mL) gave large rectangular crystals in 1.15M LiSO4, 0.1M NaOAc, pH 4.6 (4  C) when optimized (1:1 hanging drops). However these were very fragile and consisted of multiple lattices overlaid on each other as observed in their diffraction patterns. SseI 137-322 was then reductively methylated and rescreened. It gave multiple crystals of differing morphologies in a number of conditions containing MES, Tris, and HEPES buffers pH 6.0 - 9.0, and 1.6 to 2.0M (NH4)SO4. To obtain single crystals, crystals from 0.1M MES pH 7.1, 1.8M (NH4)SO4 were crushed and microseeded into pre-equilibrated (2 hrs) drops containing protein/reservoir solution (0.1M MES pH 5.5, 1.6M (NH4)SO4). This procedure produced single, small, rectangular crystals. To obtain larger crystals, single crystals obtained in the previous step were macroseeded into pre-equilibrated drops, giving large, thin rectangular plates that were well-diffracting. SeMet-substituted crystals of 137-322 were obtained in the same conditions but gave large crystals directly without any seeding. Crystals were then cryoprotected by transfer in small increments into mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol., VAPOR DIFFUSION, HANGING DROP, temperature 277.15K",4.6,2012,
